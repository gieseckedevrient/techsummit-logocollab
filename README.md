# The Giesecke+Devrient Open Source Pixel Logo

Welcome to the **G+D Open Source Pixel Logo Challenge**!  
Your mission: **Help build our company logo — one pixel at a time!**

This is a fun way to make your **first open-source contribution**.
Not many coding skills required — just a GitHub account and curiosity!

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Open [`logo.md`](logo.md) in the GitHub web editor or your local editor (e. g. VSCode).
3. Pick at least **one white pixel (⬜)** and replace it with a color pixel of your choosing, for example:

🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪

4. Commit your change with a message like:

   > `Added pixel (7, 12) in green, green, green, because my darling is a hunter.`

Where (7, 12) are the horizontal, vertical coordinates of the pixel in the grid.

6. **Open a Pull Request** in the main repository.
7. Once merged, your pixel becomes part of the live logo!

## Tip

If you’ve never used GitHub before:
- You can edit the file **directly in your browser** — no coding tools needed.
- The **“Preview”** tab shows what your pixel(s) will look like in the live logo before you commit.
- Feel free to team up with colleagues and don't hesitate to ask the Open Source Booth staff for help!
